This paper introduces the Eighth Dialog System Technology Challenge. In line with recent challenges, the eighth edition focuses on applying end-to-end dialog technologies in a pragmatic way for multi-domain task-completion, noetic response selection, audio visual scene-aware dialog, and schema-guided dialog state tracking tasks. This paper describes the task definition, provided datasets, and evaluation set-up for each track. We also summarize the results of the submitted systems to highlight the overall trends of the state-of-the-art technologies for the tasks.
