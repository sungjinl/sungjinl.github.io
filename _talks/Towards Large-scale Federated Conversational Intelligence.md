Conversational agents have become prevalent in every aspect of our lives. Conversational agents such as Alexa and Google Assistant are no longer closed applications but rather they have evolved to be an ecosystem featuring hundreds of thousands of voice skills and offer a rich set of tools to bring in unlimited number of skills, for instance, an AI-centric toolkit for voice skill authoring, seamless cold start of new skills, and traffic optimization based on user satisfaction. In this talk, I discuss recent industrial trends towards large-scale federated conversational intelligence and give a sneak peek of present challenges and approaches in industry.
